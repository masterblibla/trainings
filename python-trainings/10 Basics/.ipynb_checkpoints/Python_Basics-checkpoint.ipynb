    "Datatypes are attributes of data that tell the compiler or interpreter how the developer intends to use the data [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type). Every variable used in code is of a certain datatype. Most languages assign a datatype to a variable during initialisation. In Python this is done automatically. Also the datatype of a variable can change multiple times during its lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved due to Python not assigning a datatype, but rather every variable being a PyObject that includes all datatypes and then automatically selecting the right datatype for you. If you want to read more on this, go to [here](https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/#why-doesnt-python-have-pointers), it is not necessary to understand this topic in detail for this course.\n",
